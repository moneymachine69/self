            The horizon is like a chrome ball; the height of the observed clouds condense on the edges, getting smaller, into infinity (presumably). The horizon is the surface of a ball. The horizon extends into the distance, but there is no end. It is a loop, really.

            cars do not need to run through the forest, or the ocean. in these world(s) that the cars live in, the forests are contained. <br>
            or they are replaced with something that serves the cars. <br>
            or they are simply gone. <br>
            <br>
            where do we fit in to the world of machines? where do i fit, except, economically, as physician or trainer, realistically as fodder, and simply as a breeding ground for soft technologies of industry and control? <br>
            where do the forests fit in? <br>

            it is more like i am a ghost of an organism, then. a system applied to a vessel not built for it. a function applied to a body, and the dissonance produced.
