           <b style="color:rgb(0, 0, 255)">Which Way the Wind Blows</b> refers to a body of work which includes research, writing, code, and a kinetic sculpture. 
           The work explores how the wind, as an aspect of the weather, acts as a metaphor for embodiment of and resistance to imperial visuality. The wind carried the slave ships over the Atlantic, but the wind can change, and carries with it possibility.

            The weathervane is updated in real time with the current wind direction of specific historic and contemporary sites of US military occupation.<br>
            Every minute, the weather vane shifts, cycling through a shortlist of these places. The wall monitor is updated synchronously.
